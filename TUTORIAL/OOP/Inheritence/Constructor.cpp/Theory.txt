we can use const    ructor in derievd classess in c++
if base class constructor does not have any arguements, there is no need of any constructor in derieved.
But if there are one or more arguements in the base class constructor,derievd class need to pass arguements

In multiple inheritence, base classes are constructed in the order  in which they appear in the class declaration 

In multilevel  inheritence, the constructors are executed in the order of inheritance 


SPECIAL SYNTAX

C++ supports an special syntax for passing arguements to multiple base classes 
The constructor of the derived class recieves all the arguements at once and 
then will pass the calls to the respective base classes

The body is called after all the constructors are finished executing.
derieved-constructor(arg1,arg2,arg3,.....): base1-constructor(arg1,arg2),Base2-constructor(arg3,arg4){
    code block
}base1-constructor(arg1,arg2);


FOR VIRTUAL BASE class 

1.The constructor for vurtual base class are invoked before an non virtual class 
2.if there are  multiple virtual base classes, they are   invoked in the order declared 
3.Any non virtual base class are then constructed before the derievd class constructor is executed.
